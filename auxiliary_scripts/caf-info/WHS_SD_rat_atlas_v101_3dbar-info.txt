This model was created using 3d Brain Atlas Reconstructor – software dedicated
to reconstructing three-dimensional reconstruction from 2D slides.

This CAF dataset is based on the:

Papp, E. A., Leergaard, T. B., Calabrese, E., Johnson, G. A., & Bjaalie, J. G. (2014).
NeuroImage Waxholm Space atlas of the Sprague Dawley rat brain.
NeuroImage, 97, 374–386. http://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.04.001

The source dataset is available from:
http://software.incf.org/software/waxholm-space-atlas-of-the-sprague-dawley-rat-brain/download

The delineations were adopted from the "MBAT-ready Sprague Dawley atlas v1.01 bundle"
containing label volume with manually segmented brain regions:

Version dated on 17 Nov 2014 (md5: e470fb266f27f9a5ce060037eb68ab32) was used.

The offline version of 3dBAR allows for customizable generation of three-dimensional
structures (ie. with different resolutions or various mesh processing filters).
Final reconstructions may be exported as polygonal meshes (VRML, X3D) as well as
volumetric data (NIfTI, vtk).

Ministry of Regional Development, POIG.02.03.00-00-003/09.
